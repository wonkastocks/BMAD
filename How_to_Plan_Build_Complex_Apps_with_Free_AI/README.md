# YouTube Tutorial Extractor

## Overview

This tool helps extract structured information from YouTube tutorials to facilitate AI-assisted development. It's part of the BMAD (Build/Manage/Analyze/Deploy) methodology for using AI to build complex applications.

## Features

- Creates project folders for YouTube tutorials
- Generates customized template files for documenting tutorial content
- Provides a structured workflow for AI-assisted development
- Helps convert video-based tutorials into text that AI can effectively use

## Contents

- `extraction_template.md`: Template for documenting the tutorial content
- `workflow_guide.md`: Guide for implementing the BMAD methodology
- `youtube_extractor.py`: Python script to automate the extraction process

## Getting Started

### Using the Python Extractor

1. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x youtube_extractor.py
   ```

2. Run the script with a YouTube URL:
   ```
   ./youtube_extractor.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID
   ```
   
   Or run it without arguments and enter the URL when prompted:
   ```
   ./youtube_extractor.py
   ```

3. The script will create a new project folder with all necessary template files

### Manual Process

1. Watch the video tutorial
2. Use the extraction template to document key information
3. Follow the workflow guide to implement the project
4. Use AI tools to assist in the development process

## About the BMAD Methodology
