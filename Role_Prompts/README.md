# BMAD AI Team Role Prompts

## Overview

This directory contains specialized role prompts based on the BMAD (Build/Manage/Analyze/Deploy) methodology. These prompts allow you to transform any AI assistant into specialized team members by copying and pasting these prompts into your conversations.

## Available Roles

1. **[Project Manager](./project_manager.md)**: Handles planning, requirements, and project management
2. **[Senior Developer](./senior_developer.md)**: Designs architecture and makes technical decisions
3. **[Junior Developer](./junior_developer.md)**: Implements specific features and writes code
4. **[QA Engineer](./qa_engineer.md)**: Tests functionality and identifies bugs
5. **[Technical Writer](./technical_writer.md)**: Creates documentation for users and developers

## How to Use These Prompts

1. **Choose the appropriate role** for your current task
2. **Copy the entire content** of the role prompt markdown file
3. **Paste it into a new conversation** with your AI assistant
4. **Replace the placeholder text** (e.g., "[Project Name]") with your specific project details
5. **Replace the [Initial Request]** with your specific task for that role
6. The AI will now respond as if it were fulfilling that specialized role

## Best Practices

1. **Use one role at a time** - Start a new conversation for each different role
2. **Be specific in your project context** - The more details you provide, the better
3. **Keep a record of outputs** - Save important responses from each role to share with other roles
4. **Update the context regularly** - Add new decisions and progress to keep the AI up-to-date
5. **You are the CEO** - You make the final decisions based on input from all roles

## Example Workflow

1. Start with the **Project Manager** to define requirements and create a plan
2. Use the **Senior Developer** to design the architecture and make technical decisions
3. Have the **Junior Developer** implement specific features based on the architecture
4. Ask the **QA Engineer** to identify potential issues and test the implementation
5. Use the **Technical Writer** to document the features and usage

## Customizing Prompts

Feel free to modify these prompts to better suit your needs:

- Add project-specific details to the "Current Project Context" section
- Adjust responsibilities to match your specific requirements
- Add additional constraints or guidelines as needed

## Adding New Roles

You can create additional specialized roles following the same template structure. Some examples might include:

- **UX Designer**: Focus on user experience and interface design
- **DevOps Engineer**: Handle deployment, CI/CD, and infrastructure
- **Security Specialist**: Identify and address security concerns
- **Database Administrator**: Design and optimize database structures

Each new role should clearly define responsibilities, interaction guidelines, and current context.
