### Key Code Snippets
*Capture important code snippets shown in the video. Include timestamps for reference*

#### Snippet 1 (Timestamp: 08:45)
```javascript
// weatherService.js - API call function
const API_KEY = process.env.REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY;
const BASE_URL = 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5';

export const getWeatherData = async (city) => {
  try {
    const currentWeatherResponse = await axios.get(
      `${BASE_URL}/weather?q=${city}&appid=${API_KEY}&units=metric`
    );
    
    const forecastResponse = await axios.get(
      `${BASE_URL}/forecast?q=${city}&appid=${API_KEY}&units=metric`
    );
    
    return {
      current: currentWeatherResponse.data,
      forecast: forecastResponse.data
    };
  } catch (error) {
    throw error;
  }
};
```
*This code handles the API calls to OpenWeatherMap, fetching both current weather and forecast data in a single function.*

#### Snippet 2 (Timestamp: 15:32)
```javascript
// Inside CurrentWeather.jsx
const CurrentWeather = ({ data }) => {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Set theme based on weather condition
    const weatherCondition = data.weather[0].main.toLowerCase();
    if (weatherCondition.includes('clear')) {
      setTheme('sunny');
    } else if (weatherCondition.includes('cloud')) {
      setTheme('cloudy');
    } else if (weatherCondition.includes('rain') || weatherCondition.includes('drizzle')) {
      setTheme('rainy');
    } else if (weatherCondition.includes('snow')) {
      setTheme('snowy');
    } else {
      setTheme('default');
    }
  }, [data, setTheme]);
  
  // Component rendering...
};
```
*This code demonstrates how the app dynamically changes the theme based on current weather conditions using React's Context API and useEffect hook.*

### Data Models
*Document any data models, database schemas, or important data structures*

```
The app primarily works with the following data structures:

1. Current Weather Object:
{
  name: String,            // City name
  main: {
    temp: Number,          // Current temperature
    feels_like: Number,     // "Feels like" temperature
    humidity: Number,       // Humidity percentage
    pressure: Number        // Atmospheric pressure
  },
  weather: [{
    main: String,          // Weather condition (Clear, Clouds, etc)
    description: String,    // Detailed description
    icon: String            // Icon code
  }],
  wind: {
    speed: Number,         // Wind speed
    deg: Number             // Wind direction in degrees
  },
  sys: {
    country: String        // Country code
  }
}

2. Forecast Item:
{
  dt: Number,              // Unix timestamp
  main: {
    temp: Number,          // Temperature
    temp_min: Number,       // Minimum temperature
    temp_max: Number        // Maximum temperature
  },
  weather: [{ ... }],      // Same as current weather
  dt_txt: String           // Date and time text
}

3. Recent Search:
{
  id: String,              // Unique ID
  city: String,            // City name
  country: String,         // Country code
  timestamp: Number        // When the search was made
}
```

### API Endpoints
*Document any API endpoints created or consumed*

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Request Format | Response Format |
|----------|--------|---------|----------------|------------------|
| `api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather` | GET | Get current weather | `?q={city}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric` | JSON (Current weather object) |
| `api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast` | GET | Get 5-day forecast | `?q={city}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric` | JSON (List of forecast items) |

### UI/UX Design
*Describe the user interface shown in the tutorial, including any specific design patterns or layouts*

```
The app features a clean, minimalist design with a responsive layout:

- Top section: Search bar with autocomplete dropdown and a toggle for temperature units
- Middle section: Current weather display with large weather icon, temperature, and "feels like"
- Bottom section: Horizontally scrollable 5-day forecast cards on mobile, grid layout on desktop

The UI incorporates a dynamic background gradient that changes based on weather conditions:
- Clear: Warm yellow/orange gradient
- Cloudy: Blue/gray gradient
- Rainy: Dark blue/purple gradient
- Snowy: Light blue/white gradient

A skeleton loading state is shown while data is being fetched, and error messages
appear in a dismissable card at the top of the screen when API errors occur.
```

## AI Development Instructions

### Priority Features
*List the most important features that should be implemented first*

1. Basic search and current weather display with proper API integration
2. Error handling and loading states
3. Forecast display with grouped-by-day data

### Implementation Guidance
*Provide specific instructions for the AI about how to approach building this project*

```
When implementing this project:

1. Start with setting up the API service and environment variables first
2. Focus on getting the data flow working before styling components
3. The most complex part is the forecast grouping logic at 25:30 - pay special attention to this
4. For the theme changing feature, use a context at the app level rather than passing props
5. Implement responsive design from the beginning rather than adding it later
```

### Custom Requirements
*Add any custom requirements or modifications you want compared to the original tutorial*

```
I'd like to make these modifications to the original tutorial:

1. Add geolocation to automatically detect the user's city on first load
2. Include a toggle for temperature units (°C/°F)
3. Add weather alerts if extreme conditions are detected
4. Update the UI with a more modern design using a design system
```
